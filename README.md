# Wumpus World
## Problem description: 
The Wumpus world is a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways. Lurking somewhere in
the cave is the terrible Wumpus, a beast that eats anyone who enters its room. The Wumpus can be
shot by an agent, but the agent has only one arrow. Some rooms contain bottomless pits that will trap
anyone who wanders into these rooms. The only mitigating feature of this bleak environment is the
possibility of finding a heap of gold. The full PEAS description of the Wumpus world is given in
Section 7.2 of Russell and Norvig’s AI textbook.
For this project, you will use the exact same specifications as the one given in the book, with one
exception: instead of a small grid, you’ll be using a larger 10 X 10 grid.
